Why do we need loop invariants?
- loop invariants are needed to show that for each iteration of the loop, the conditions before
during, and after the loop are still and always true. It helps reason about initial conditions and connect it to
the termination conditions of the loop so that every step is correct. They also ensure that the loop is moving closer
to the end goal. 

Why do we streets weakest pre-conditions more than strongest port-conditions?
- using weakest preconditions are calculate "backwards" from postcondition to precondition. Strongest postconditions are calculated
"forwards" and are not always unique and can be harder to work with. WP is also less computationally expensive to compute. It is also
the least restrictive condition under which an algorithm can finish and satisfy the postcondition.

What to tools did you use to implement your verifier?
- The verifier is implemented in Dafny and using the Z3 prover.

Read about Boogie and z3 (in our context) and explain the difference in your words
- Z3 is an SMT solver from Microsoft Research. Z3 is an efficient SMT solver for logical formulas with specialized algorithms for solving
background theories. Essentially, it takes in as input simple formulas that contain symbols with pre-defined meanings which are 
called theories. 
- Boogie is an IVL (Intermediate Verification Language) that is used to describe the logic of a program. 
It is a high-level language that is used to describe the logic of a program, intened as a layer to build program verifiers for other languages. 
The Boogie tool accepts the Boogie language as input and generates verification conditions that are the PASSED to a SMT solver like Z3 to compute.
Boogie can translate high-level code into a formal representation which are verification conditions. So you could say that Boogie
"uses" Z3 to check if generated verification conditions are satisfiable.
