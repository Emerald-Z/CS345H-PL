Due: 10/20/2025

Given starter code:

- A proposed parser-combinator library (ParserCombinators.hs)

    The standard library has one of those but it is useful to learn how
    those things are put together

- A proposed lexer (FunLexer.hs)

- A proposed concrete parser (FunSyntax.hs)

- An proposed lexer/parser driver Main.hs

- A proposed AST (Term.hs)

- A proposed small-step spec (Small.hs)

- A proposed interpreter

Your assignment:

- understand the sample code
- combine your language proposal from p1 with your experience so far to
  propose a new language design.
- Fully specify your design using the small-step framework and the parser
  combinators.
- Feel free to change/enhance the proposed frameworks
- Submit pull requests with the proposed changes
- Those proposals will be the basis for our future work.

Language features:

- Supports integers, booleans, and strings
- Dynamically typed
- Lexically scoped
- Supports functions
- Supports basic arithmetic and logic
- Supports basic control structures (if statements, while loops, ...)
- Can do I/O
- The interpreter never crashes

Point distribution:

- Design 40%
- Implementation 40%
- Contributing by making and/or reviewing pull requests 20%
