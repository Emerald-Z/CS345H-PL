- What changes did you propose/implement to:

    * language syntax
        - added support for binary operations: +, -, *, /, ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=
        - added support for lexing boolean operations: &&, ||, !
    * language semantics
        - added support for file parsing into the sytax loosely from p2a
    * the parser-combinator library
    * the small-step framework
    * the small-step spec
        - Supports integers, booleans(true, false), and strings (single quotes) 
            * Lists in the form of tuples
                * NewTuple, GetTuple(gets the value at the index), SetTuple (sets the value at the index)
                * currently only sets a single index at a time
                * tuples are expressed as [value1, value2, value3, ...]. accessed as tuple[index], set as tuple[index] = value
                * index out of bounds is an error
        - Dynamically typed 
        - Lexically scoped
            * "Linked list" structure of scopes (each scope has a pointer to the parent scope)
            * function calls push a new scope
            * closures capture the arguments as local scope
        - Supports functions
            * supports functions with one or more arguments
                * arguments are evaluated before being passed to the function, pass-by-value
                * arguments must be valid
            * supports functions with no arguments
        - Supports basic arithmetic and logic Y
            * Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %
            * Boolean operations: &&, ||, !
            * Comparison operations: ==, <, >
        - Supports basic control structures (if statements, while loops, ...)
            * supports try-catch statements with any error kind
            * supports try-catch statements with specific error kinds (type, input, variable not found, arguments)
        - Can do I/O
            * supports print statements
        - The interpreter never crashes
